The aim of this project is to assess the efficacy of various machine learning models on employee attrition data and subsequently employ XAI (SHAP) to provide both local and global interpretability for the model predictions. These are the main objectives:
<br>
Evaluate various metrics, including accuracy, precision, AUC, recall, F1 score, etc., in order to determine the optimal machine learning algorithm or ensemble method for the construction of an employee attrition model.
<br>
In order to highlight the impact of various factors contributing to employee turnover using XAI (eXplainable AI) such as SHAP, an analysis will be conducted utilizing summary plots, dependence plots, individual force plots, and collective force plots. This analysis will ensure that the prediction model can be interpreted both locally and globally.
